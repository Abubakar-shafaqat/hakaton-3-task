# Marketplace Deployment Preparation - Day 6

## Objective
Prepare the marketplace for production by setting up a **staging environment**, configuring hosting platforms, and ensuring the application is functional, secure, and reliable before going live.

---

## Steps Overview

### 1. Hosting Platform Setup
- **Platform Choice:**  
  Used **Vercel** for deployment (fast and user-friendly) and **GitHub** for version control.  
  Future scalability options include AWS or Azure.

- **Repository Connection:**  
  - Connected GitHub repo to Vercel for automatic deployments.
  - Configured build settings and added necessary scripts for smooth operation.

---

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
- **Local Setup:**  
  Created a `.env` file to include sensitive data like API keys and tokens.  

- **Hosting Setup:**  
  Uploaded environment variables securely through the Vercel dashboard.

---

### 3. Deploy to Staging
- **Application Deployment:**  
  - Logged into Vercel and selected the GitHub repository.  
  - Deployed the application to a staging environment via Vercel's build process.

- **Deployment Validation:**  
  - Verified logs to ensure the build completed without errors.  
  - Tested basic functionality on the staging URL:
    - Confirmed all pages loaded correctly.
    - Verified key features like user login, product listings, and search functionality.
    - Ensured no broken links or missing assets.

### 4. Staging Environment Testing
- **Testing Conducted:**  
  - Functional Testing  
  - Security Testing  
  - API Testing  

- **Test Case Reporting:**
